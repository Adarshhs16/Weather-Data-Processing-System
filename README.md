# Weather-Data-Processing-System
This project implements a Real-Time Data Processing System for monitoring weather conditions across major cities. The system retrieves and processes weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API to provide summarized insights, including daily aggregates, alerts for extreme weather conditions, and visualizations of weather trends.
